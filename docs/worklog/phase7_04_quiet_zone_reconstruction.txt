Phase 7.4 Work Packet: Quiet-Zone Reconstruction

Objective
- Improve decode success for noncompliant inputs with missing/violated quiet zones.

Primary Files
- src/lib.rs
- src/decoder/qr_decoder.rs
- src/detector/* (optional helper)

Implementation Scope
1. Detect likely QR boundary from finder geometry + edge density.
2. Estimate where quiet zone should exist around candidate grid.
3. Synthesize/virtually enforce quiet-zone margin in validation stage.
4. Relax quiet-zone checks only for this fallback mode.
5. Guard with confidence checks to avoid false positives.

Constraints
- Do not relax global validation for normal path.
- Quiet-zone reconstruction should be optional and bounded.

Tests
- cargo test --lib
- Add tests with artificially cropped/no-quiet-zone matrices.

Acceptance Criteria
- Standard compliant decode path unchanged.
- Reconstructed quiet-zone path recovers specific noncompliant fixtures.
- No major false-positive increase on clean subset.

Deliverables
- Code + tests.
- Notes on fallback trigger conditions.
