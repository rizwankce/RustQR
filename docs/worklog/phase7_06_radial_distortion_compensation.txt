Phase 7.6 Work Packet: Local Radial Distortion Compensation

Objective
- Compensate lens/display distortion before final grid sampling.

Primary Files
- src/decoder/qr_decoder.rs
- src/utils/geometry.rs

Implementation Scope
1. Estimate simple radial distortion parameter(s) from finder/alignment layout residuals.
2. Add forward/inverse correction mapping for sampling coordinates.
3. Evaluate corrected vs uncorrected sampling on same candidate transform.
4. Keep corrected path only when structural confidence improves.

Constraints
- Use low-parameter model first (k1 only).
- Run only when distortion indicators exceed threshold.

Tests
- cargo test --lib
- Add unit tests for mapping stability and monotonicity.
- Add one synthetic distorted fixture test if feasible.

Acceptance Criteria
- No regressions in existing golden tests.
- Corrected path activates only when warranted.
- Targeted gain on monitor/perspective hard cases.

Deliverables
- Code + tests.
- Lightweight diagnostics for distortion estimate usage.
