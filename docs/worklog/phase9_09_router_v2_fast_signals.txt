# Phase 9.9 - Category-Triggered Router v2 from Fast Signals

## Goal
Route each image to a minimal effective strategy set using fast pre-signals to improve both speed and hit rate.

## Scope
- Add fast signal extraction: blur metric, saturation ratio, skew estimate, region density proxy
- Map signals to strategy profiles

## Files
- src/pipeline.rs
- src/bin/qrtool.rs
- src/lib.rs

## Implementation Tasks
1. Implement fast signal extraction in pre-decode stage.
2. Define deterministic routing profiles and thresholds.
3. Ensure router integrates with budget controller.
4. Add telemetry:
   - router_profile_selected
   - router_profile_success_rate
   - router_profile_runtime

## Validation
- Run fast benchmark across top weighted categories and compare profile performance.

## Success Criteria
- Weighted-global improvement with same or lower median runtime.

## Deliverables
- Router v2 policy + telemetry + tuned threshold note.
