Phase 7.3 Work Packet: Two-Finder + Timing Geometry Fallback

Objective
- Recover detections when only two reliable finder patterns are available.

Primary Files
- src/lib.rs
- src/detector/finder.rs
- src/decoder/qr_decoder.rs

Implementation Scope
1. Add a fallback grouping mode for 2 finder patterns.
2. Infer the third anchor using:
   - timing-line direction and spacing
   - plausible QR dimension constraints.
3. Build candidate transforms from inferred corner set.
4. Validate candidates via timing alternation and format extraction plausibility.
5. Decode only top-scored fallback candidates.

Constraints
- Two-finder path must run only when 3-finder grouping fails.
- Keep strict candidate cap to prevent explosion.

Tests
- cargo test --lib
- Add synthetic tests where one finder is missing but timing remains clear.

Acceptance Criteria
- No regressions on standard 3-finder cases.
- Two-finder fallback triggers only in failure path.
- At least one noncompliant/damaged scenario recovered in targeted test set.

Deliverables
- Code + tests.
- Brief telemetry fields indicating when 2-finder fallback was used.
