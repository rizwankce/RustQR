Phase 7.8 Work Packet: Failure-Cluster Triage Loop

Objective
- Build a repeatable loop to cluster misses by failure signature and prioritize fixes by impact.

Primary Files
- src/bin/qrtool.rs
- src/tools/*
- scripts/* (new)
- docs/* (summary output)

Implementation Scope
1. Extend benchmark artifact with richer failure signatures:
   - no-finders
   - no-groups
   - transform-fail
   - format-fail
   - rs-fail
   - payload-fail
   - over-budget skip.
2. Add script to cluster and rank failure signatures by frequency and QR-count weight.
3. Output top clusters with representative image paths.
4. Generate a short action report linking clusters to likely pipeline stages.

Constraints
- Script must run offline from saved artifact.
- Keep report deterministic and machine-readable.

Tests
- Run script on existing benchmark artifacts.
- Verify stable output ordering and counts across repeated runs.

Acceptance Criteria
- Produces ranked top-N failure clusters with actionable stage mapping.
- Enables phase planning based on data instead of anecdotal misses.

Deliverables
- Script + docs note on usage.
- Sample report artifact committed under docs/ or temp output path.
