# Phase 9.10 - Failure-Signature-Driven Tuning Loop

## Goal
Replace broad heuristic tuning with artifact-driven, signature-targeted tuning iterations.

## Scope
- Use failure cluster artifacts to select top weighted miss signatures
- Tune only targeted knobs and validate each change against baseline

## Files
- scripts/triage_failure_clusters.py
- scripts/compare_reading_rate_artifacts.py
- scripts/* (new helper as needed)
- src/bin/qrtool.rs

## Implementation Tasks
1. Add script step to extract top-N weighted failure signatures from candidate artifact.
2. Produce actionable tuning queue (signature -> likely subsystem -> proposed knobs).
3. Add a lightweight report generator for before/after per-signature outcomes.
4. Document merge criteria based on signature improvements.

## Validation
- Run loop on latest baseline and one candidate run.
- Confirm report shows attribution, not just global delta.

## Success Criteria
- Every merged tuning change includes signature-level gain evidence.
- Reduced tuning churn and fewer regressions.

## Deliverables
- Scripts + report format + documented triage workflow.
