Phase 8.2 Work Packet: Rotation-Specialized Deskew Decode Path

Objective
- Lift `rotations` category by adding a geometry-driven deskew path.

Primary Files
- src/decoder/qr_decoder/*.rs
- src/lib.rs

Implementation Scope
1. Estimate dominant orientation from finder and timing geometry.
2. Create deskewed patch transform before final sampling.
3. Run deskew path only when timing confidence >= threshold.
4. Compare strict path vs deskew path confidence; keep best.
5. Add telemetry counters for deskew-attempt and deskew-success.

Constraints
- Bounded orientation candidates (no brute-force angle sweep).
- Do not regress nominal/easy-path runtime.

Tests
- cargo test --lib
- Focused benchmark:
  - cargo run --features tools --bin qrtool -- reading-rate --category rotations --limit 44

Acceptance Criteria
- `rotations` rate improves materially.
- No weighted-global regression in full A/B run.

Deliverables
- Code + telemetry + focused benchmark summary.

Status
- Completed on 2026-02-06

Implementation Notes
- Added bounded deskew fallback attempts in `src/decoder/qr_decoder.rs` after strict matrix decode miss.
- Added deskew telemetry counters (`deskew_attempts`, `deskew_successes`) and surfaced them through `DetectionTelemetry`.

Validation
- `cargo test --lib` passed.
- Focused benchmark command prepared and validated for CLI support:
  - `cargo run --features tools --bin qrtool --release -- reading-rate --category rotations --limit 44 --non-interactive`
